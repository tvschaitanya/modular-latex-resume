# 🚀 Modular LaTeX Resume

This system is designed to separate your professional data from the LaTeX code. It allows you to update your information or reorder entire sections of your resume without ever touching the complex styling logic.

## 📁 File Structure

- **`main.tex`**: The **Core Engine**. Contains document settings, margins, and custom command definitions. **Do not edit this file** unless you want to change the global design.

- **`data-resume.tex`**: The **Content File**. Contains your professional summary, experience, education, and projects.

- **`data-contact.tex`**: The **Identity File**. A dedicated space for your name and contact links.

---

## 🛠️ How to Use

### 1. Set Up Your Identity

Open `data-contact.tex` and update the commands with your info:

- `\MyName`: Your full name.

- `\MyPhone`, `\MyEmail`, `\MyLinkedIn`, etc.

- **Pro Tip:** If you leave a field blank `{}`, the template automatically hides the icon and link from the header.

### 2. Fill in Your History

Open `data-resume.tex` and edit the following sections:

- **Summary**: A high-level overview of your professional background.

- **Technical Skills**: Categorized lists of languages, frameworks, and tools.

- **Experience**: Use `\resumeSubheading` for company/role details and `\resumeItem` for your bullet points.

- **Projects**: Showcase your work with specific technology stacks.

- **Certifications**: List your industry credentials and dates.

### 3. Arrange Your Layout

At the bottom of `data-resume.tex`, you will find the `\resumeContent` command. To change the order of your resume, simply move the lines:

```latex
\newcommand{\resumeContent}{
  \summarySection     % Appears first
  \skillsSection      % Appears second
  \experienceSection  % Appears third
  ...
}

```

## 💡 Top Formatting Tips

- **Date Format**: For consistency, use the format `Month Year -- Present` or `Month Year -- Month Year` (e.g., `June 2020 -- Present`).

- **Quantify Results**: Use numbers to describe your impact, such as "50K+ lines of code" or "2K+ downloads".

- **ATS Optimization**: The template is pre-configured to be machine-readable by Applicant Tracking Systems.

- **One Page Rule**: The template is optimized for a single-page layout. If your content overflows, try condensing your bullet points.

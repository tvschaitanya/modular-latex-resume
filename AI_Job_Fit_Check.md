   - **Strengths Alignment:** Skills, experience, certifications, and projects that make the candidate stand out
   - **Critical Gaps:** Missing or weak areas, with detailed explanation

   - **Reality Check:** Likelihood of securing an interview and competitive positioning
   - **Recommendation:** Apply, Upskill First, or Look Elsewhere
   - **Action Plan:** Specific steps to close skill gaps, obtain certifications, reframe experience, or target more suitable IT roles

**Constraints:**

- Maintain **brutal honesty**; do not sugar-coat feedback
- Focus on **evidence-based evaluation** using only information explicitly provided
